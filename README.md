# City-Explorer

**Author**: Pat Haynes
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
    We are providing users with information based on locations of interest. All of the locations will be cities. We will be providing weather info and handle the backend information. The user will only need to input their city of interest. In case of an error we will provide a polite message letting them know of the wrong entry. The problem domain is to provide a visitor map of an area for the user to explore as well as weather, movies, events, trails, and reviews.
